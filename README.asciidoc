A starting point for C++ projects using SDL2

This is a project that I created for my games programming module (CGP2011M). The code is based on an SDL2 template provided by the module professor. All other code is written by me, and uses the SDL2 library. The code is a recreation of Chuckie Egg, the video game.


The code template is from https://github.com/shearer12345/sdl2template
